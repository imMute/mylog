* irssi-mylog.pl pukes when a message is stored from a nick that is longer than 32 characters
  - this is because the store nick silently truncates the stored value; the next time that a
    message from that nick is attempted to insert, the lookup of the nick_id fails (because its
    been truncated) but then inserting the new nick_id HARD FAILS because of the UNIQUE constraint
  - solution is to either make the nick column longer, or truncate before looking up the nick
